    </h1>
    <p>I am Jon Snow . even though that line is enough for people in westeros to recognize me I am gonna elaborate on it.
        I though I was a bastard from winterfell but it turns out I am the child of ned Stak's sister.<br> My father was a Targarian
        thats why my identity was hidden even to me. But I became the lord commander I deafeated the night king and then I killed my love 
        Danerys Targarian.<br>
         which was fucked up cause she was pretty hot. fast forward I am the lord commander again so thats why I want  
        a new Job.</p>
